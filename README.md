# HELICOPTER ESCAPES 


The title of this project is _HELICOPTER ESCAPES_. This is actually a project I wrote under the dataquest [_guided projects_](https://app.dataquest.io/m/610/guided-project%3A-prison-break/5/get-the-data). This project was created May 19, 2022. This README.md file was created May 21, 2022. There have been multiple instances of prison escapes whereby an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter. One of the earliest instance was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico. France has recorded more helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 15 cases. One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber, Michel Vaujour, studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter. Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison.

## DESCRIPTION 



This is a python project that uses tools like pandas, numpy and matplotlib to analyze and visualize helicopter prison breaks data in a table available on Wikipedia. This project is written as a jupyter notebook. The helper.py file provided by dataquest contains some helper functions and codes. This project answers interesting questions like:
- Nmber of helicopter escape attempts per year 
- The year with most attempts
- Number of occurrences per country 


## RESULTS 


### Number of helicopter escape attemps per year

From the figure above, the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occured in 1986, 2001, 2007, and 2009. Each of the four years has 3 attempts.

### Number of occurrences per country
Country |	Number of Occurrences 
-----|-----
France | 15
United States |	8
Greece |	4
Belgium |	4
Canada |	4
United Kingdom | 2
Australia |	2
Brazil |	2
Italy |	1
Puerto Rico |	1
Netherlands |	1
Russia |	1
Chile |	1
Ireland |	1
Mexico |	1

From the table above, France has the highest number of occurrences of helicopter escapes.
